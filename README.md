## Theme

## Tooling

Contains both UglifyJS & Closure Compiler. Uglify is faster than Closure, but Closure's output is slightly smaller.

First, install everything and set up a fast feedback loop:

```
npm install
bower install
npm run start
```

Then, start counting bytes and ship it:

```
npm run build
npm run test
npm run base64
```
